# Heart Failure clinical records <img src="img/heart.png" width="120" height="120" align="right"/>

Heart failure occurs when the heart is not able to pump enough blood to the body.<br>
HF are only a subgroup of all the **cardiovascular diseases** that comprehend also coronary heart diseases (heart attacks), cerebrovascular diseases (strokes) and other pathologies that altogether kill every year  approximately **17 million people** around the world.<br>


Machine learning applied to medical records can be useful to  predict the survival of a patient, highlighting patterns and even ranking the features to understand which are **risk factors**, possibly undetectable by doctors.<br>
In this notebook the analisys will be done starting from an **EDA** to understand the dataset and applying some **preprocessing** to be able to learn properly from it.<br>
Then will follow a number of **machine learning models** trained on the preprocessed dataset, aiming to predict the **survival** of patients that suffered HF.<br>
The results are presented at the end of the notebook.
